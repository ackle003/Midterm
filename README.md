# Midterm
im dumb and idk what im doing

Okay so for the midterm this is what I got done:

--- Requirements That Are Met ---
   -> Menu Scene
   -> At least two scenes
       - Game Scene
       - Death Scene
       - Win Scene
      
--- Things That We Still Need ---
   -> Event Handling
        - So I understand how it works and how to code it but I have no idea how to implement it for our game, maybe we can all discuss this on Monday
        
        
--- Things to Know ---
   -> There is Out Of Bounds Death
   -> There is code that checks if the player has gotten the key, I checked with debuggin and moving the key to see if the door will open
   -> To open the door you have to be on top of it, and press the up key 
   -> If you die it'll take around 5 seconds for the game to load the menu screen, ofc we can change this to replay the scene and we can also change the load time, I just thought 5 seconds was a good amount of time to wallow in sorrow for the fact that you couldn't jump from one column to the other in a basic af game
